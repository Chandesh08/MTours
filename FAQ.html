	<h4>Why should I book through the website?</h4>
	<p>When you book via the Mauritius Attractions website you enjoy selection of benefit:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Enjoy the special 10-20% discounts given on online bookings</li>
		<li>Guarantee in advance your place on the activity you desire</li>
		<li>Book any trip on the time and date which suit you most</li>
		<li>Save the hassle of traveling to our office</li>
		<li>Have the option of paying in Euro / USD / GBP using all major credit cards</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you book through the Mauritius Attractions website, you benefit our special 10%-20% website discount given on online orders and you already guarantee in advance your place on the activity you desire.</p>
	<p>In addition to the special website prices, when booking online you can be relaxed and assured that the activity / trip is reserved and booked for you on the time and date that suit you most. You also save the hassle of traveling from your place of accommodation to our office to make the bookings.</p>
	<h4>Do you offer special promotions?</h4>
	<p>Yes we do! Every month we offer special promotion rates on few selected trips. These promotion prices are valid as of the time of order. This means that in case you order an activity when it is offered for a promotion price and then after the price of this activity increases, you will still benefit from the special promotion price which you have paid.</p>
	<p>You can find the list of special offers on our <a href="specialOffers.html">Special Offers page.</a></p>
	<h4>How many days in advance should I book the trips?</h4>
	<p>There is no one clear answer to this question because the answer very much depends on the activity in which you are interested in and on the period of the year for which you would like to make the booking.</p>
	<p>For our most popular activities and trips such as the dolphin’s trips, Ile aux Cerfs trips, walking with lions adventure and many more, we do recommend finalizing the booking enough time in advance during any period during the year. This is of course even more relevant during the peak season (November – February), where we are usually fully booked for the majority of the activities, and advance booking is a must!</p>
	<h4>What should I bring on the day of the trip / activity?</h4>	
	<p>On the day of each trip/activity you should bring the voucher which we have sent you by email following your booking. This voucher is your proof of booking</p>
	<p>The voucher also includes all the relevant details regarding your booking and regarding the activity itself, such as: the departure point, start / end time, activity description, local contact numbers, and also a list of what to bring and not to bring for that activity.</p>
	<h4>Which currencies do you accept?</h4>
	<p>Payment via our website can be done in the following currencies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dollar</li>
		<li>Euro</li>
		<li>GBP</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Can you provide full transportation services for all trips?</h4>
	<p>Yes, of course! MTours offers complete ground handling transportation services, including: airport transfers, private tours, and transportation to all sights and excursions anywhere in Mauritius.</p>
	<p>The fleet of vehicles meets every customer’s requirements from individual customers to large groups, and includes: selection of family cars, convertibles cars, luxury cars, 4x4 vehicles, minivans and mini-buses.</p>
	<h4>Do you also organize trips for groups?</h4>
	<p>Yes we do. We offer range of incentive activities, trips, excursions and sightseeing tours for groups of all sizes ranging from small groups of 10 people to big organization consisting of hundreds of participants.<br><br>In case you require any travel arrangements for big groups, please contact us and we will do our very best to customize our trips and tours as per your group preferences.</p>
